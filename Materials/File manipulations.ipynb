When a file is used as an iterator, typically in a for loop (for example, for line in f: print line), the ```next()``` method is called repeatedly. This method returns the next input line, or raises StopIteration when EOF is hit. In order to make a for loop the most efficient way of looping over the lines of a file (a very common operation), the ```next()``` method uses a hidden read-ahead buffer. As a consequence of using a read-ahead buffer, combining ```next()``` with other file methods (like ```readline()```) does not work right. However, using ```seek()``` to reposition the file to an absolute position will flush the read-ahead buffer. New in version 2.3.\n",

    "### ```read(size)```\n",
    "> Read at most size bytes from the file (less if the read hits EOF before obtaining size bytes). If the size argument is negative or omitted, read all data until EOF is reached. The bytes are returned as a string object. An empty string is returned when EOF is encountered immediately. (For certain files, like ttys, it makes sense to continue reading after an EOF is hit.) Note that this method may call the underlying C function ```fread()``` more than once in an effort to acquire as close to size bytes as possible. Also note that when in non-blocking mode, less data than what was requested may be returned, even if no size parameter was given.\n",

A trailing newline character is kept in the string (but may be absent when a file ends with an incomplete line).2.11 If the size argument is present and non-negative, it is a maximum byte count (including the trailing newline) and an incomplete line may be returned. An empty string is returned only when EOF is encountered immediately. Note: Unlike stdio's ```fgets()```, the returned string contains null characters ('\\0') if they occurred in the input.\n",

The whence argument is optional and defaults to 0 (absolute file positioning); other values are 1 (seek relative to the current position) and 2 (seek relative to the file's end). There is no return value. Note that if the file is opened for appending (mode 'a' or 'a+'), any ```seek()``` operations will be undone at the next write. If the file is only opened for writing in append mode (mode 'a'), this method is essentially a no-op, but it remains useful for files opened in append mode with reading enabled (mode 'a+'). If the file is opened in text mode (without 'b'), only offsets returned by ```tell()``` are legal. Use of other offsets causes undefined behavior.\n",

The current file position is not changed.

Availability: Windows, many Unix variants.\n",

    "> If Python was built with the --with-universal-newlines option to configure (the default) this read-only attribute exists, and for files opened in universal newline read mode it keeps track of the types of newlines encountered while reading the file. The values it can take are ```\\r```, ```\\n```, ```\\r\\n```, ```None``` (unknown, no newlines read yet) or a tuple containing all the newline types seen, to indicate that multiple newline conventions were encountered. For files not opened in universal newline read mode the value of this attribute will be None.\n",

    "> Boolean that indicates whether a space character needs to be printed before another value when using the print statement. Classes that are trying to simulate a file object should also have a writable softspace attribute, which should be initialized to zero. This will be automatic for most classes implemented in Python (care may be needed for objects that override attribute access); types implemented in C will have to provide a writable softspace attribute. Note: This attribute is not used to control the print statement, but to allow the implementation of print to keep track of its internal state.\n"
