But defining functions in Python means knowing both types first: built-in and user-defined. Built-in functions are usually a part of Python packages and libraries, whereas user-defined functions are written by the developers to meet certain requirements. In Python, all functions are treated as objects, so it is more flexible compared to other high-level languages."

To use the function draw_game from the draw module, we would need to specify in which module the function is implemented, using the dot operator.
