    "Python works using interpreter. The Python interpreter is usually installed as ```/usr/local/bin/python3.7``` on those machines where it is available; putting ```/usr/local/bin``` in your Unix shell’s search path makes it possible to start it by typing the command to the shell. On Windows machines, the Python installation is usually placed in C:\\Python36"

    "\n",
    "The interpreter operates somewhat like the Unix shell: when called with standard input connected to a tty device, it reads and executes commands interactively; when called with a file name argument or with a file as standard input, it reads and executes a script from that file.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second way of starting the interpreter is ```python -c command [arg]``` ..., which executes the statement(s) in command, analogous to the shell’s -c option. Since Python statements often contain spaces or other characters that are special to the shell, it is usually advised to quote command in its entirety with single quotes."
